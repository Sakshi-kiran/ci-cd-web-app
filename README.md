"CI/CD Web App - Automating Deployment Using Docker, GitHub Actions, and AWS EC2"

Problem Statement: Deploying web applications manually can be slow and prone to errors. Many organizations face challenges with manual deployments, such as inconsistencies between environments, human error, and longer time-to-market for new features.


Solution: This project implements a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the deployment of a simple web application. Using GitHub Actions, Docker, and AWS EC2, the pipeline ensures the app is automatically built, tested, and deployed with each new code update, making the process faster and more reliable.
